To start Mysql: go to cloud9 terminal and enter: mysql-ctl cli
There is no username nor password which works out perfectly. 
To start hosting the website, clikc run at the top. A terminal tab will open with the host url.
MAKE SURE TO STOP HOST WHEN YOU'RE DONE PROGRAMMING. Can run in to complications if someone tries to code and someone else has it up and running. 

This can also be helpful. It's the documentation link for cloud9: https://docs.c9.io/docs
